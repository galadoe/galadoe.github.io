About Me Section

Galadoe Kulee was a student at Iowa State University School of Engineering, pursing a degree in Software Engineering taking a semester off, in hope to gain practical experience. Her fascination with computing (programming) started when she was in junior high school and led her to learn to code on her own. As an immigrant and a woman of color, she comes from a community that is woefully underrepresented in the Science, STEM fields, therefore, she wants to be a part of changing the under-representation of black women in the tech space.

With that being said, Galadoe is a very passionate about working with others to achieve the overall objective of any institution or group she am a member of. While the technology space is rapidly changing and advancing, she wants to continue learning to stay up to date
